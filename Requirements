# Arduino-Based Temperature Monitoring System

This repository contains the code and resources for an Arduino-based temperature monitoring system. The project includes scripts for reading data from the Arduino, logging data, visualizing data in real-time, and a web interface for monitoring temperature.

## Introduction

This project provides an easy-to-build and customizable temperature monitoring solution using Arduino and various sensors. The Python scripts included in this repository allow for serial data reading, data visualization, and web-based real-time monitoring.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Supports multiple types of temperature sensors.
- **Data Logging**: Logs temperature data to a file.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays temperature data in real-time using Matplotlib and a web interface.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to add new sensors or features.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Arduino board with a temperature sensor
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
